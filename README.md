# Monster Wrangler

In Monster Wrangler, players assume the role of a knight tasked with capturing specific target monsters from among various colored monsters. As levels advance, players face greater challenges and must act quickly, precisely, and strategically. Catching the designated monster earns points, but beware â€” capturing the wrong one results in a penalty.

## Features

Four Monster Types: Blue, Green, Purple, Yellow

Player Controls: Use arrow keys to navigate the player.

Special Move: Use space bar to perform a warp that transports the player to a safe zone.

Scoring System: Points are awarded based on the monsters caught. Bonus points are also provided for speedy level completions.

Dynamic Difficulty: As players progress, the number of monsters and the game's complexity increase.

## Gameplay

The game presents a target monster image at the screen's top. Players must navigate the arena and capture monsters that match this target.

Each level introduces more monsters. To progress to the subsequent level, players must capture all matching monsters.

Capturing an incorrect monster deducts a life. Depleting all lives ends the game.

Players can deploy the warp function (using the space bar) to teleport to a safety zone. Note: Warp uses are limited.
